# About Me:
<p>  I call myself a Constructive Technology Aggregate or CTA which is my job title for OgFOMK ArTS, my company. This title has to do with putting together pieces of data, image, sound or stuff to create new things. These are the building blocks which I call the aggregate. I come from a background of commercial concrete and I have built many projects using my hands and digital technology. I also have experience in shooting, moving and communication which comes from being a forward observer in the US Army. Finally I started a 'zine back 1987 called OgFOMK ArTS which pulled me into the direction of learning more than I thought I would ever have to.
